# JavaScript-MP8

A data visualization using D3 for the Olympic Medals Scores overtime.

We started by collecting data of the olympic medalists record time from 1948 to 2008,
then imported the data onto MP8.html, using the d3 library to create the data visualization.

I personally completed the middle portion of the MP8.html by importing the medalist data, and 
write the functions for d3 and worked on the CSS portion

I plan in implementing jQuery for animations for the chart, as well as .mouseover so we can have
the information for each medalist and the time pop up when we hover our mouse over the dots.
